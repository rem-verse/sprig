## `serial2-tokio-rs` ##

Our code we use to interact with serial devices is
originally based off of commit: 65ff229f65c27c57e261f94dc6cc9a761cce9b21
for the repository: <https://github.com/de-vri-es/serial2-tokio-rs>.

We forked our code off of this because we wanted to add some specific cat-dev
specific logging, features, etc. We also wanted to update the dependencies, and
architect the code to fit in with the rest of our codebase well.
